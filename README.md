I'll create a Python script that processes an Excel file according to your requirements, with detailed comments about each calculation. This script will use pandas and openpyxl to handle the Excel operations.

# Excel Gas Flow Analysis Processor

I've created a Python script that processes Excel data according to your requirements. The script follows all the calculation formulas from your PDF and properly handles the gas flow analysis.

## Features

- Reads an Excel file with gas flow data
- Performs all the calculations specified in your instructions
- Includes detailed comments for each formula
- Creates a new Excel file with calculated values
- Generates a summary sheet with key statistics

## How It Works

The script:
1. Opens your Excel file (tries to find the "Refined Gerdau Data" sheet)
2. Skips the header rows (starts at row 16)
3. Performs all the calculations from your instructions and the PDF
4. Generates a new Excel file with all calculated values
5. Adds a summary sheet with key statistics (max/min/average values)

## How to Run the Script

1. Save the code as `calculate.py`
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy openpyxl
   ```
3. Run the script with your Excel file:
   ```
   python calculate.py your_excel_file.xlsx [optional_output_name.xlsx]
   ```

If you don't specify an output filename, it will automatically create one based on your input filename with "_processed" added.

## Calculations Included

The script implements all the calculations shown in your PDF, including:

- Natural gas flow rates
- Molar flow calculations for all gases (CO2, H2O, N2, O2, CO, NOx)
- Temperature differentials in Celsius and Kelvin
- Energy calculations for each gas component
- Volumetric flow rates
- Gas velocities
- Summary statistics for key metrics

## Excel Output

The output Excel file contains:
1. A "Processed Data" sheet with all calculations
2. A "Summary" sheet with key statistics:
   - Maximum/minimum/average energy values
   - Average volumetric flow rate
   - Maximum/minimum/average velocities
   - Temperature bounds and averages

The script also automatically adjusts column widths for better readability.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the code in more detail?
